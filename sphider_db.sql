Some drugs, such as marijuana and heroin, can activate neurons because their chemical structure mimics that of a natural neurotransmitter. This similarity in structure fools receptors and allows the drugs to attach onto and activate the neurons. Although these drugs mimic the brains own chemicals, they dont activate neurons in the same way as a natural neurotransmitter, and they lead to abnormal messages being transmitted through the network.\n					 \n					\n					\n					 \nOther drugs, such as amphetamine or cocaine, can cause the neurons to release abnormally large amounts of natural neurotransmitters or prevent the normal recycling of these brain chemicals. This disruption produces a greatly amplified message, ultimately disrupting communication channels.					 \n					\n					 \n						Most drugs of abuse directly or indirectly target the brain''s reward system by flooding the circuit with dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter present in regions of the brain that regulate movement, emotion, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. When activated at normal levels, this system rewards our natural behaviors. Overstimulating the system with drugs, however, produces euphoric effects, which strongly reinforce the behavior of drug use teaching the user to repeat it.\n					 \n				 \n				\n				\n			 \n			\n				\nDo you want to help.

Therefore, health care practitioners diagnose these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental-health information. The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual''s primary-care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person''s general health and to explore whether or not the individual currently has drugs in their system or has a medical condition that might have mental-health symptoms.\n\n					 \n				 \n				\n			 \n			\n				\n\n\n\n   You may have a substance use disorder if at least two of these issues occur within a 12-month period: \n  \n    You often take larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended \n\n    You want to cut down or quit, but haven''t been successful \n\n    You spend a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug \n\n    You have intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts \n\n    \n    You aren''t meeting obligations and responsibilities because of your substance use \n\n    You keep using the drug, even though you know it''s causing problems in your life \n\n    You give up or cut back important social, occupational or recreational activities because of your substance use \n\n    You use the substance in situations that may be unsafe, such as when driving or operating machinery \n\n\n    You use the substance even though you know it''s causing you physical or psychological harm \n\n    You develop tolerance, which means that the drug has less and less effect on you and you need more of the drug to get the same effect \n\n    You have physical or psychological withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking the drug, or you take the drug (or a similar drug) to avoid withdrawal symptoms \n\n  \n  \n  \n   \n \n\n\n					\n				 \n				\n				\n			 \n			\n				\nDo you want to help.

While many are aware of the abuse of legal substances like alcohol or illegal drugs like marijuana (in most states) and cocaine, less well known is the fact that inhalants like household cleaners are some of the most commonly abused substances.\n\n					 \n				 \n				\n			 \n			\n				\n\n\n\n   List Group With Contextual Classes \n  \n    Alcohol \n     Although legal, alcohol is a toxic substance, particularly to a developing fetus when a mother consumes this drug during pregnancy. One of the most common addictions, alcoholism can have devastating effects on the alcoholic individual''s physical health, as well as his or her ability to function interpersonally and at work. \n    Amphetamines \n     This group of drugs comes in many forms, from prescription medications like methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and dextroamphetamine and amphetamine (Adderall) to illegally manufactured drugs like methamphetamine ("crystal meth"). Overdose of any of these substances can result in seizure and death. \n    Cocaine \n      A drug that tends to stimulate the nervous system, cocaine can be snorted in powder form, smoked when in the form of rocks ("crack" cocaine), or injected when made into a liquid. \n    Cannabis \n     Marijuana (cannabis) is the most commonly used illicit substance. This drug impairs short-term memory and learning, the ability to focus, and coordination. It also increases heart rate, can harm the lungs, and may increase the risk of psychosis in vulnerable people. \n    \n    Heroin \n     Entitled the “king of narcotics”.After ingestion, heroin quickly enters the brain to bind to you body’s opioid receptors, which are involved with the perception of pain and feelings of reward and pleasure. Opioid receptors are also located in the brainstem, a small but vital part of the brain that controls automatic responses such as breathing, blood pressure, and consciousness. By targeting these sites, heroin produces an intense but short-lasting high, deadly overdose symptoms, tolerance, and dependence. \n    Meth \n     Methamphetamine is a white crystalline drug that people take by snorting it, smoking it or injecting it with a needle. Some even take it orally, but all develop a strong desire to continue using it because the drug creates a false sense of happiness and well-being—a rush of confidence, hyperactiveness and energy. One also experiences decreased appetite. \n    Ecstasy \n     (MDMA) Tends to create a sense of euphoria and an expansive love or desire to nurture others. In overdose, it can increase body temperature to the point of being fatal. \n    Sedative, hypnotic, or antianxiety drugs \n     As these substances quell or depress the nervous system, they can cause death by respiratory arrest of the person who either uses these drugs in overdose or who mixes one or more of these drugs with another nervous system depressant drug (like alcohol, another sedative drug, or an opiate).  \n  \n  \n   \n \n\n\n					\n				 \n				\n				\n			 \n			\n				\nDo you want to help.

Doctors prescribe these medications at safe doses and monitor their use so that you''re not given too great a dose or for too long a time. If you feel you need to take more than the prescribed dose of a medication, talk to your doctor.\r\n					 \r\n					 Preventing drug abuse in children and teenagers \r\n					 \r\n					Take these steps to help prevent drug abuse in your children and teenagers:\r\n					 \r\n					 \r\n					  Communicate.  Talk to your children about the risks of drug use and abuse. \r\n					  Listen.  Be a good listener when your children talk about peer pressure, and be supportive of their efforts to resist it. \r\n					  Set a good example.   Don''t abuse alcohol or addictive drugs. Children of parents who abuse drugs are at greater risk of drug addiction. \r\n					  Strengthen the bond.  Work on your relationship with your children. A strong, stable bond between you and your child will reduce your child''s risk of using or abusing drugs. \r\n					 \r\n				 \r\n				\r\n			 \r\n			\r\n			\r\n				\r\nDo you want to help.

Facts about the use of drug treatment include that less than 10% of people with a substance-abuse disorder and less than 40% of those with a substance-dependence disorder seek professional help. Those statistics do not seem to be associated with socioeconomic or other demographic traits but do seem to be associated with the presence of other mental-health problems (co-morbidity).\n\n					 \n				 \n				\n			 \n			\n				\n					 \nThe primary goals of drug-abuse or addiction treatment (also called recovery) are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation. During the initial stage of abstinence, an individual who suffers from chemical dependency may need help avoiding or lessening the effects of withdrawal. That process is called detoxification or "detox." That aspect of treatment is usually performed in a hospital or other inpatient setting, where medications used to lessen withdrawal symptoms and frequent medical monitoring can be provided. The medications used for detox are determined by the substance the individual is dependent upon. For example, people with alcohol dependence might receive medications like anti-anxiety (benzodiazepines) or blood pressure medications to decrease palpitations and blood pressure, or seizure medications to prevent possible seizures during the detoxification process. For many drugs of abuse, the detox process is the most difficult aspect of coping with the physical symptoms of addiction and tends to last days to a few weeks. Medications that are sometimes used to help addicted individuals abstain from drug use long term also depend on the specific drug of addiction. For example, individuals who are addicted to narcotics like Percodan (a combination of aspirin and oxycodone hydrochloride) heroin, or Vicodin, Vicodin ES, Anexsia, Lorcet, Lorcet Plus or Norco (combinations of hydrocodone and acetaminophen) often benefit from receiving longer-acting, less addictive narcotic-like substances like methadone (Methadose). People with alcohol addiction might try to avoid alcohol intake by taking disulfiram (Antabuse), which produces nausea, stomach cramping, and vomiting when the individual consumes alcohol.\n\n					 \n					\n					 \n					Often, much more challenging and time consuming than recovery from the physical aspects of addiction is psychological addiction. For people who may have less severe drug dependency, the symptoms of psychological addiction may be able to be managed in an outpatient treatment program. However, those who have a more severe addiction, have relapsed after participation in outpatient programs, or who also suffer from a severe mental illness might need the higher structure, support, and monitoring provided in an inpatient drug treatment center, sometimes called "rehab." Following such inpatient treatment, many people with this level of addiction can benefit from living in a sober living community, that is, a group-home setting where counselors provide continued sobriety support and structure on a daily basis.\n\n					 \n					\n					\n					 \n					Also important in the treatment of addiction is helping the parents, other family members, and friends of the addicted person refrain from supporting addictive behaviors (codependency). Whether providing financial support, making excuses or failing to acknowledge the addictive behaviors of the addict, discouraging such codependency of loved ones is a key component to the recovery of the affected individual. A focus on the addicted person''s role in the family becomes perhaps even more acute when that person is a child or teenager, given that minors come within the context of a family in nearly every instance. Chemical dependency treatment for children and adolescents is further different from that in adults by the younger addict''s tendency to need help completing their education and achieving higher education or job training compared to addicts who may have completed those parts of their lives before developing the addiction.\n					 \n					\n					 \n					The treatment of dual diagnosis seems to be less effective when treatment of the individual''s mental illness is separate from the treatment of his or her chemical dependency. More successful are integrated treatment programs that include interventions for both disorders. Such interventions are all the more improved by the inclusion of assessment, intensive case management, motivational interventions, behavior interventions, family treatment as well as services for housing, rehabilitation, and medication treatment.\n					 \n				 \n				\n				\n			 \n			\n				\nDo you want to help.
